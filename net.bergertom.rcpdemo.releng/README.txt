== This is the RCPdemo project ==
I created this project as a minimal RCP applicaton using Oxygen1 (4.7.1a)
so that I can test eclipse functionality
This project duplicates the setup of a larger E4 application.

== to build ==
right click on "RCPdemo.launch" and run the M2 task
this will start the maven tycho build and create the binary distribution
located in folder (releng.product/target)

== to run directly from Eclipse ==
